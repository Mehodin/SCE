# Idea
SCE is to be an Integrated Development Environment. It focuses on integrating existing tools such as compilers, debuggers, editors, analyzers and refactoring tools.

# Goals
- Be able to integrate external tools with relative ease.
  - Common tools should be integrated by default.
  - Unknown tools should be integratable using descriptions of what input to send where, what output to display where and when to run the tool.
- Avoid implementing existing functionality, such as font rendering, syntax highlighting, editing features and so on. Integrate existing tools instead.
- Integrate enough tools to be a more useful aid in development than existing IDEs.

# State
- SCE is not usable as an IDE yet. It is missing core features such as being able to save a file.
